## Welcome
Welcome to the OWASP
[Vancouver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vancouver) chapter home page.
We are located in the beautiful province of [British
Columbia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Columbia), on the West
Coast of [Canada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Canada).

Our mission is to enrich Vancouver's application security community. We
hope you can join us in accomplishing that.
